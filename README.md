This repository contains the information on biomedical relation extraction.

Relationship extraction is the task of extracting semantic relationships from a text. Biomedical relation extraction is useful for extracting relations between biomedical entities such as Genes, Proteins and Drugs from research publications and articles.

### PPI Corpora

The most widely studied corpus for biomedical relation extraction is a set of 5 corpuses (Aimed, Bioinfer, hprd50, iepa, lll) for protein-protein interactions. Although released by different groups, all these corpuses were studied and converted to a single format in [Pyysalo et al, 2008](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-S3-S6) and the conversion software is available at http://mars.cs.utu.fi/PPICorpora/.

Due to different pre-processing steps and evaluation strategies, it is often difficult to compare results reported by different systems. Nevertheless, following are some of the important papers which have reported performance on these datasets.
